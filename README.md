# Card game prototype #
This project supposed to be a **demo version** of a card game, which is planned to be later released as a standalone app for mobile.

Right now it's just a prototype of a basic combat flow, since game mechanics are incomplete, but it will be updated on a semi-regular basis.

### TODO ###
- [x] Basic layout
- [x] Card generation and turn system
- [x] Buff/debuff modifications (almost ready)
- [ ] Appropriate visual, lol
- [ ] Adding team combat
  
### Idealistic TODO
- [ ] Adding map progression
- [ ] Adding hub (managing team members and resources)
- [ ] Switching from **Vanilla JS** to framework (most possibly **Vue**)
- [ ] Adding backend (most possibly **RoR** and **MongoDB**)
- [ ] Write Dev Diary
